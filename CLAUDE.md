# CLAUDE.md — Korakuen Management System

This file is the entry point for Claude Code. Read this first. Then read the specific document relevant to your current task before writing any code.

## What This System Is

A custom management system for **Korakuen**, a small Peruvian construction company founded February 2026. Three partner companies collaborate on civil works projects (roads, sidewalks, small police modules) under both subcontractor and OxI (Obras por Impuesto) frameworks.

The system replaces spreadsheets with a structured database. It gives the partners real operational visibility — cost tracking, invoice management, payment calendars, partner contribution balances — without the complexity of an ERP.

**This is not a prototype.** The database is production infrastructure. Every decision in these documents was deliberate. Do not change architectural decisions without explicit discussion.

---

## Core Principle

**The database is the product. The website is how data gets in and out.**

- Data entry: Website (primary) + Python CLI (legacy, 6 modules remaining)
- Data storage: PostgreSQL on Supabase
- Data visualization: Next.js website on Vercel
- File storage: SharePoint (external, referenced by naming convention only)

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|---|---|
| Database | PostgreSQL on Supabase |
| Database management | Supabase CLI (migrations, views, SQL execution) |
| CLI application | Python 3.11+ |
| Website | Next.js + TypeScript on Vercel |
| Package manager (Python) | pip + virtualenv |
| Package manager (JS) | npm |

## Database — 17 Tables

```
Layer 1: partner_companies, bank_accounts, entities, exchange_rates, categories
Layer 2: tags, entity_tags, entity_contacts, projects
Layer 3: project_partners, quotes
Layer 4: invoices, invoice_items
Layer 5: payments
Layer 6: loans, loan_schedule
Layer 7: project_budgets
```

**Never add, remove, or modify tables without reading `docs/08_schema.md` first and getting explicit approval.**

Key facts:
- All primary keys are UUID
- All tables have `created_at` and `updated_at`
- Soft deletes only — never hard delete any record
- Amounts always stored in natural currency (USD or PEN) — never converted at storage
- Exchange rate mandatory (NOT NULL) on all financial tables — stored at historical rate per transaction, enables application-layer conversion
- IGV, detraccion, and retencion tracked separately on all financial records
- Totals and payment balances are always derived via views — never stored
- No business logic triggers — all derived data computed at query time (only `updated_at` auto-timestamp triggers exist)

---

## Critical Business Rules

- **Peruvian tax reality:** Every financial transaction has IGV (18%), potentially detraccion (varies %), potentially retencion (3% on receivable only — Korakuen is NOT a retencion agent)
- **Unified invoice model:** `invoices` table with `direction` column (`'payable'` or `'receivable'`) replaces separate costs/AR tables. `invoice_items` holds line items. Category lives on invoice_items, not the header
- **Informality is normal:** entity_id, comprobante fields, and document_ref are all nullable on invoices — cash purchases and informal suppliers are valid
- **Partner identity:** All financial tables (invoices, payments, loans) have explicit `partner_company_id`. Bank accounts belong only on payments (cash movements), not on invoices
- **PO module hook:** `invoices` has both `quote_id` and `purchase_order_id` fields — both nullable. Currently `quote_id` is used directly. `purchase_order_id` is reserved for a future Purchase Orders module — always null
- **No stored totals:** subtotal, igv_amount, total on invoices are derived from invoice_items via `v_invoice_totals`. Payment status derived from payments via `v_invoice_balances`
- **Tags are universal:** one `tags` table serves both entity categorization and project roles
- **Project code drives everything:** PRY001, PRY002... — auto-sequential, used in all SharePoint filenames

## Skills

Before performing any of these tasks, read the corresponding skill file first.

| Task | Skill File |
|---|---|
| Write CREATE TABLE SQL | `skills/sql_schema.md` |
| Write database view SQL | `skills/sql_views.md` |
| Write a Python CLI module | `skills/cli_script.md` |
| Write import functions within a CLI module | `skills/import_script.md` |
| Generate or update TypeScript types | `skills/ts_types.md` |
| Audit the codebase | `skills/codebase_audit.md` |

Skills live in `/skills/`. Read the full skill file before starting — they contain specific patterns, rules, and code examples that must be followed exactly.

## Behavior Rules for Claude Code

### Always do:
- Read the relevant document before starting any task
- Discuss approach before writing code
- Follow naming conventions in `docs/10_coding_standards.md` exactly
- Show a summary and ask for confirmation before any database insert
- Write comments on non-obvious code
- Update `TODO.md` task status when tasks complete

### Never do without explicit approval:
- Modify the database schema
- Drop or truncate any table
- Edit migration files that have already been applied
- Change the document reference naming convention (`PRY001-AP-001`)
- Add external dependencies without discussion
- Push to `main` branch
- Store credentials in any committed file
- Convert currency amounts at storage time

### When in doubt:
- Ask before building
- Refer to the schema document — it is the source of truth
- Prefer simpler solutions over clever ones
- If a task seems to conflict with a documented decision, raise it before proceeding

## Current Status

**Development complete.** CLI application (6 modules), database (17 tables, 10 views), and visualization website (7 pages) are all built and deployed. Production live at `https://korakuen.vercel.app`. V1 unified invoice model deployed — `costs`, `cost_items`, `ar_invoices` replaced by `invoices` + `invoice_items`.

**Key architecture:** Universal partner filter (cookie-based, sidebar toggle) applied across all 7 pages. All data is visible to everyone — loans, financial position, everything. Partners are toggled freely via the sidebar filter; Apply button refreshes data. No role-based visibility restrictions.

**Loans are partner-owned.** Every loan has a `partner_company_id`. Business rule: 10% return on loans, borrower keeps the spread between agreed return and what they pay the lender.

See `TODO.md` for remaining work.
