-- View: v_invoice_balances
-- Purpose: Shows amount_paid, outstanding balance, and payment_status per invoice.
--          Tracks detraccion_paid and retencion_paid separately for accurate splits.
--          Handles cross-currency detraccion payments (always PEN, even for USD invoices).
--          Works for both payable and receivable directions (replaces v_cost_balances + v_ar_balances).
-- Source tables: v_invoice_totals, payments
-- Used by: v_obligation_calendar, invoice detail pages, payment tracking, entity detail, financial position
